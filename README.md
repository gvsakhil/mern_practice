This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you have both backend and frontend code:

Run npm install or npm i to install all dependencies

### `npm start` runs react code

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### type `cd backend` to navigate to backend folder
### make sure mongodb is running and type `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js` and make use of the React code :)

### Happy Coding :)
